This project is a project I developed at the end of 2019 when I first started Game Development.

I am not proud of this project that I have done while I am new to C# and Unity. But I don't mind keeping it as a memento.

You can come across structures that are far from optimization and modularity as much as possible, don't worry. Just grab a cup of coffee and examine the chaos a beginner developer can create.

Good readings.
